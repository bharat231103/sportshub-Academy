    <p class="info">Kabaddi is a contact team sport played between two teams of seven players, originating in ancient India. <br> The objective of the game is for a single player on offense, referred to as a "raider", to run into the opposing team's half of the court, touch out as many of their players as possible, and return to their own half of the court, all without being tackled by the defenders in 30 seconds. <br> Points are scored for each player tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for stopping the raider. <br> Players are taken out of the game if they are touched or tackled, but return to the game after each point scored by their team from a tag or tackle. <br>

        It is popular in the Indian subcontinent and other surrounding Asian countries. <br>Although accounts of kabaddi appear in the histories of ancient India, the game was popularised as a competitive sport in the 20th century. <br>It is the national sport of Bangladesh. It is the second most popular and viewed sport in India after cricket. <br>It is the state game of the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh</p>

    <p class="info">Tennis is a racket sport that is played either individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). <br> Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court.  <br>The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. <br>The player who is unable to return the ball validly will not gain a point,  while the opposite player will. <br>

        Tennis is an Olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages. <br> The sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket, including wheelchair users. <br>The original forms of tennis developed in France during the late Middle Ages. <br> The modern form of tennis originated in Birmingham, England, in the late 19th century as lawn tennis</p>

    <p class="info"> Chess is a board game for two players.<br>It is played on a square board, made up of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares in each row and column. <br>Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king.<br> The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. <br>Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.<br>

        During the game, the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. <br>One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board.<br> The player with white pieces always makes the first move.Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.</p>
